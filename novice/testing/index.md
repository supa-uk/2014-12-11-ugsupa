Testing is often viewed with trepidation, we know we should do it, we know it can be useful.
Yet for some reason it always gets put on the back-burner, something else is more important.
This can be lack of planning, feature creep, you name it, there is always an excuse.

To give a big definition early - 
Software testing is the process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between 
existing and required conditions (that is, bugs) and to evaluate the features of the software item.

What we hope to do:
* Show the benefits of testing
* Explain why testing may not be being done
* Show some different types of test
* Highlight the pitfalls
