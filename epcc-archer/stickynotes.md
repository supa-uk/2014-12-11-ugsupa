* Good intro to the git world. 
* Liked the concept of git. Nicely taught.
* Going through git commands is helpful esp. branching.
* Git seems really useful, nice intro.
* Git is cool - very nice introduction, nice to see how GitHub and BitBucket work.

* Good useful material.
* 100% cool - nothing bad.
* Was pretty easy to follow.
* Happy with what has been done so far.
* Thought it was well organised and hands on.
* Organised well, screens by every table and plenty of available help.
* I liked the facilities, I liked git, I liked the class.
* Well done, could easily follow it. Cooperation bit is nice. Good speed.
* Pace was good as the possibility to go to MoPad to get urls.
* Lots of writing (but kinda necessary).
* Very clear instructions, easy to follow.
* Nice room choice
* The MoPad is very useful.
* I like the green cards.
* The sticky system with coloured sticky notes, very thorough, lots of examples.
* Speaker was patient to answer the questions.
* The helpers were v. useful.
* Really good helping. 
* Demonstrators.

Negatives:

* Merge and tag a bit confusing.
* Don't know what tags do.
* Tags.
* I'm still a bit confused on branches.
* Maybe a bit more could be covered? e.g. a little bit more time on branching and/or using tags e.g. process a file with current and my old revision.
* A bit more on remotes, collaborations. A bit more on explaining history and commits.
* Could mention pull requests (for open source when you have no write access  for the repo) and git stash. Could mention git GUI for commits structure(?)
* Not enough examples to play around.
* Perhaps a look at a very used, real world example (lots of files and big log).
* Speaker was not very clear on how why to choose git over svn on other version control.
* Did not know what git was for a while, more of an intro would have helped me.
* I would have liked to hear about why it is handy to use git before starting to use it. Now I see (it is!) but would be good to hear about earlier.
* Sometimes the usage does not correlate to the narrative.
* Maybe the explanation was quite fast to follow at some moments.
* It was a little too fast.
* Little fast for amateurs like me.
* Sometimes commands were gone from screen too quickly.
* Went a wee bit fast, got a bit behind.
* Sometimes is difficult to get back when you lost the track!
* Notes of the specific commands studied would be useful!
* Should write down the exercise instructions in case people fall behind in case people fell behind. Maybe on etherpad? or on the screen?
* A lot of dead time waiting for the next example.
* Session finished 20 mins earlier, perhaps you could have given an intro on what is version control and why it is "best practice".
* Maybe less people per session so it's easier to proceed the course.
* One could set up pairs for the shared repository at the beginning.
* I can't see the instructor from here.
* Would be good to have approx. log in advance, as a guide, so we can look ahead and back.
* I really don't like the fact that I slept very little last night and feel tired.
* No real problems.

## Building programs with Python

Positives:

* Lots of examples to try functions by ourselves - best way to learn (by trying it out).
* IPython seems super useful and I didn't know about it before.
* I had never used Python, now I'm curious about it.
* Challenges (exercises) and using timeit to time code were interesting

* Nice and easy to understand yet not overly simplistic data sets.
* Learned a lot.
* Learned a lot.
* Good course structure.
* Very good.

* Distributing files in git.. very useful / easy!
* Links were useful.
* All pleasant and good!
* Thank you very much, very helpful.
* Interactive! Makes it easier / more fun to learn.
* Great having all presentations / code snippets in repo.
* Online log of terminal is really helpful.
* Automatic logs of demonstrations very cool …
* Website with publicly accessible txt file of terminal log.
* Helpful hints / notes in Etherpad.
* Enough & very helpful assistants.

Negatives:

* From an absolute beginner perspective would have appreciated a better explanation of the steps of building up a function.
* Not that helpful for those who know Python already.
* Random programming exercises? Why?
* Trying to remember Python syntax.
* Spent too much time in basis and didn't explore best practices.
* Hard for people who do not speak Python, very easy otherwise.
* My function was slow.
* Need more info of what/why is a function - does it relate to paradigms of OO, pure, etc.
* Did not cover about using Python for compiling programs.
* A little bit basic if you already know Python.
* Doing exercises that required more knowledge than given in the class.
* Sometimes the speaker is saying more than needed - too informative
* Could have covered more.
* Could have mentioned if-else.
* I wanted to work through all the sets of slides - more time needed.
* Sessions on NumPy / IPython / MatPlotLib were a bit rushed.
* Too little time to actually try something interesting without knowing some basic syntax (even Googling every possible "how to [generic operation]" takes way too much). 
* Not enough time to actually try the exercises.
* Really fast at the start. Would be good to tell students to brush up / get NumPy working before the course.
* A bit hectic at times (good to have approx. log in advance, as a guide, so we can look ahead and back).
* Pre-written text file of the codes would be more useful.
* Slow sometimes, fast some others.
* A little bit too slow.
* A bit too slow.
* A bit slow.
* Slow.
* Bit slow.
* A bit basic.
* Need more problems to do so people with a bit of Python experience have more to keep trying.
* Slow pace.
* Online record of session didn't seem to be complete.
* Coffee break too long!
* Still very sleepy.

## Automating tasks with Make

Positives:

* Good examples. Good book.
* Loved it. Can you show "publication" work flow?
* Brilliant stuff. I will def. use this.
* I didn't know anything about make, so all was very useful.
* I learnt lots of $ syntax!
* Confusing syntax was well explained.
* Nice example.
* Make only builds new files when the ones it depends on have changed/updated.
* make is really useful for saving time. Really liked the session.
* Automation. Well taught with good exercises.
* How to use make to automate basic tasks.
* Nice introduction to good tool.
* Performing repetitive runs of multiple scripts. The concept of documentation/work timeline in a makefile.
* Very clear, tidy lesson. Exercises aligned with the level. 
* Very useful information.
* Very interactive. Interesting books too!
* Make will be very helpful for compiling and linking!
* Clear explanation about make docs! Previously thought that make was used only for compiling Fortran codes.
* Level of automation possible. Amount of control.
* Very good introduction to make.
* Learned a lot. Much more confident in it.
* Make seems to be a powerful tool for dealing with code outputs and manipulation.
* Make files will be useful for me in future.
* Maybe encourage visual inspection of graph outputs to catch $(DAT_FILE) expansion problems in dependencies.
* Very helpful helpers/staff. 
* Great tutorial / speaker and helpers.
* Helpers very helpful.
* Good to use python and git (practice for stuff learnt in day 1).

Negatives:

* What is the point of ".PHONY"? Is it necessary?
* The need for .PHONY targets.
* If Make works well why have CMake, Ant etc? Is Make the best to learn for 'modern' needs?
* Could mention (or switch to) CMake. Would be good to have a cheat sheet explaining available macros.
* It feels painful to debug syntax.
* None (too cryptic).
* The syntax (build a time machine)
* Syntax is confusing (I know you said not to put this but I followed that pretty well and can think of no other immediate concerns. I'm sure I'll find some later!)
* A new version with a better syntax.
* A little complicated commands. They need a lot of practice to get used to them.
* Challenges were just copy/paste.
* Generally, it would be good to have additional exercises available so that if the initial examples are finished early, advanced examples can be attempted.
* I don't like the wording of the problems instructions. Can you make them a bit more clear for novices?
* A bit confused at some point, but finally OK.
* Slightly too quick in the beginning.
* A little bit too quick.
* Would have liked more time to practice.
* I would prefer to be quicker at understanding.
* Could have gone faster to fit more in
* Anarchy.
* No real negative feedback.
* Only positive feedback :)

## How (and how much) to test programs

Positives:

* Almost never tested my scripts before so enjoyed learning about importance and ways of doing it.
* Useful "testing" procedures that can make my life easier.
* It served as a good introduction to numerous topics. I liked that it didn't focus too much on any one thing.
* Nosetests is good. More about that?
* Really useful. Extensive examples for comprehension.
* Very good introduction to testing with a good amount of examples.
* Good to learn about some testing tools in Python.
* Important. Well-taught.
* Testing is important so I'm glad it was covered, but should have been shorter.
* Good walk through.
* Some good general tips.
* Again lots of useful stuff. Great to learn about better testing. Assertions look really useful.
* I didn't know there were ways to test code without putting annoying print statements all over the place and messing up structure => good to know.
* Demonstrations displayed the myriad ways in which a program may be tested (as opposed to the simple "is it right?" method)
* Testing concepts great. I would have kind of liked a general testing plan or methodology.
* Good motivation why testing is important; good to do it in Python - integrates well with day 1 material; nice examples of issues with floats.
* Testing methodology well explained.
* I don't think I considered the importance of testing previously.
* Managed to convey how important testing is.
* Made me think of (previously) unforeseen problems that I might have to test for.
* Audience participation and good examples into testing. Unit testing and brief intro to testing frameworks was very nice.
* I liked the attempts at interaction.
* Very helpful in general. Thank you very much!
* It was very useful, I'll start using it.
* Very useful.
* I liked learning about unit testing tools.
* Well paced.
* Perfect. Thank you.
* All good.
* Fun and fab and very clear and amusing and well paced (thanks Alistair)!
* 5/5.

Negatives:

* Python debugging tools?
* Import numpy vs. import numpy as np inconsistent.
* Would have liked to learn more about automation testing.
* Real world example of how testing works on large projects would have been nice.
* Please include some info on how to find out more about nosetests for future reference.
* Got a bit obscure at points. Was confused of what I was doing.
* Later examples were over-convoluted given what they were trying to convey.
* I could never really connect to the usefulness of this. Never really understood what we were doing. Just copied screen! No real exercise.
* It was really code heavy and often it was easy to miss the point/big picture.
* A bit chaotic session. Python code could have been cleaner. Time could have been devoted to exploring unit tests in greater detail.
* A little bit lost with the test examples. Maybe a more introduction to the package nose and its functionalities. And some simpler examples.
* Code not well explained as we went along. I found myself copying without understanding why code had form it did.
* Program to test should be simpler.
* It would have been useful if we had been writing tests for one of the codes we made previously - then we would have properly understood what the code we were testing was meant to do.
* Some things could learn online but still good.
* Some of the first tests seemed a bit pedantic.
* I think the testing part should have been shorter. I think doing the tests is partly common sense.
* A little bit fast to follow the "programming" part.
* Missing more examples.
* Further examples to be worked on after the event.
* More testing examples would be nice.
* Think the pace is too slow.
* Rather too slow and Python-specific.
* Please put the code in the etherpad!
* Quite a bit boilerplate. Also would be nice to have source at intermediate points (less typing).
* A bit long and tiring. Maybe this could be a 3 day course.
* Would be more beneficial if it was spanned over 3 days rather than 2. We'll get more time to practice at home.
* No negative feedback.
